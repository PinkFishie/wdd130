            <p>Utah is a landlocked state in the Mountain West, bordered by five states and home to over three million people. It is known for its vast and varied geography, including the Great Basin, and is home to the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the capital, Salt Lake City. The state has a diverse economy, with key sectors in technology, mining, education, and tourism. Despite its low population density, it has experienced rapid growth since the 2000s and is recognized for high rankings in healthcare, education, and governance. Despite all this, Utah faces its challenges of increasing droughts and water scarcity.</p>
