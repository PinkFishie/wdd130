                    Hi! I'm Andrew Mitchell. I am a graphic design student at BYU-Idaho, passionate about combining creativity with modern design principles. My favorite color is fuschia. Outside of art, I stay active with calisthenics, performing feats like handstands and human levers, and I enjoy dancing as a form of self-expression. I also spend time at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Institute of Religion, where I connect with others and grow spiritually. In the future, I would love to design for companies like Trove Brands and Owala, creating stylish and functional water bottles.
                </p>

                <img src="images/newutahflag.jpg" alt="Utah flag">
                <p>Utah is a landlocked state in the Mountain West, bordered by five states and home to over three million people. It is known for its vast and varied geography, including the Great Basin, and is home to the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the capital, Salt Lake City. The state has a diverse economy, with key sectors in technology, mining, education, and tourism. Despite its low population density, it has experienced rapid growth since the 2000s and is recognized for high rankings in healthcare, education, and governance. Despite all this, Utah faces its challenges of increasing droughts and water scarcity.</p>
